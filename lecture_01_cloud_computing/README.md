# Lecture 01: Cloud Computing

We had TCP/IP and DNS in 1989
##### What was it invented for?
- Share scientific results between scientists all across the world. Before this it was based on email correspondance and hard to get papers.

## Three Requirements to Get The Internet Growing

###Software
- We need a client (browser) and a server (e.g. Apache, Nginx).
- They were all propietary and thus only specific server and clients can function togeather....what we needed were standards.

###Standards
- Transfer (mostly request) Protocol: i.e. HTTP
- Encoding: (i.e. HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, MIME TYPES)
- Security: P&I (public key inframstructure, certificates etc...)
- Naming: URLs
- NAvigation: Hyperlinks

###Content Generation
- Web was created with HTTP, HTML, and URL. He took hyperlinks (existed for local machines) and expanded to the network. The rest was added later.
- Pages generated on text editors, originally.
- Then dynamic content came about on both the client and server.
- Client-side: Javascript, Flash, Applets, CSS3, Shockwave
- Server-side: ASP, .NET, NodeJS, CodeIgnitor, PHP, Rails, Django

##Cloud Computing Slides
- Push servers into the cloud, not managed my us but somewhere outside of our interbal structures.

###Key Properties
- High availability
- Comodity -> renting a server (no upfront cost)
- Pooled resources i.e. Amazon Data Center bought and services many people
- Network accessible
- Elastic (if you need more, you can increase easily, can grow/expand as needed easily)
- Metered billing, instead of long term hosting agreements.
- Virtualization (take 1 server and make it behave as multiple to customers)
- Automation (Data centers got that much bigger, automated server depoyment and management and upkeep)

###Benefits
- Shift: CAPEX -> OPEX
    - Capital expenditure - > Operating Expendature
        - One time cost of infrastructure (e.g. building/furnature) -> Ongoing expendature (e.g. Internet, Electricity, Salary)
        -  Better for startups and companies with less capitol.
        - Also better for bigger companies (unless you don't care about full control).
            - Buy in bulk, always cheaper.
            - Proximity to cheap power/water for cooling etc... cheap land/electricity.
            - Build your own data-center if you're big enough.
- Instant Agility: Need based usage.
- Security: Restrics physical access to data, big company has good security and you get to leverage their security practices and people.
- Reliability: Redundant infrastructure, multiple data-centers.

###Challenges
- To be continued
